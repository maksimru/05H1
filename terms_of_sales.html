                  <p>The following terms and conditions (the "Terms") apply to all purchases of OSHI Defender® ("Product") sold by Aveas Limited (“Aveas”) through this online store website (the "Site")."You" or "Your" refers to the individual who has placed an order to purchase the Product through the Site. Any policy or materials specifically referred to in these Terms are incorporated into the Terms by reference. Please read the Terms below carefully. By placing an order on the Site, You agree to abide by these Terms. These Terms do not affect any mandatory and/or statutory rights that You have as a consumer under applicable law.</p>
                  <h5>1. Order and Acceptance.</h5>
                  <p>A Product order submitted by You constitutes Your offer to Aveas to purchase the Product pursuant to these Terms and is subject to acceptance by Aveas. Any prices or Product referred to on the Site are subject to availability and do not constitute an offer by Aveas. After you place an order, Aveas may send you a communication confirming receipt of Your order and containing the details of Your order. You agree and understand that any such communication confirming receipt of Your order does not constitute acceptance of Your order by Aveas. Aveas’ acceptance of Your order becomes effective when Aveas dispatches the Product ordered by You and accepts Your payment.</p>
                  <h5>2. Price and Payment Terms.</h5>
                  <p>a. Prices payable for Product are those in effect at the time of Product dispatch, unless expressly agreed otherwise. Despite our efforts, occasionally an error in the price or description of a Product may be reflected on the Site. In such case, Aveas will contact you for instructions before dispatch where you have the option to cancel your order or proceed to place order based on revised price or description of a Product.</p>
                  <p>b. Aveas reserves the right to withdraw any discount and/or to revise any Product price on the Site at any time prior to acceptance of Your order. The final Product price will be reflected prior to your confirmation of Your order.<p>

                    <li><p>(ii) Exclusive of tax, VAT, or duty of any kind which (where applicable) must be added to the price payable.</p></li>
                    <li><p>(iii) You agree to pay VAT, taxes, shipping or handling for the Product as specified on the Site when You submit Your order.</p></li>

                  <p>e. Payment will be charged upon dispatch of the Product. Aveas reserves the right to verify credit or debit card payments prior to its acceptance of Your order.</p>
                  <p>f. For invoiced payments, each invoice will be due on and payable within the time period noted on Your invoice, measured from the date of the invoice. If at any time you fail to pay any amount due on the relevant due date, Aveas may by notice declare all invoiced amounts unpaid at that date to be immediately due and payable.</p>
                  <p>g. No set-off or counterclaim may be deducted from any amount payable by You to Aveas without written consent of Aveas.</p>

                  <p>c. Risk of loss of or damage to the Product passes to You upon delivery or when placed in your possession.</p>
                  <p>d. If You refuse or fail to take delivery of Product provided in accordance with these Terms, any risk of loss or damage to the Product shall nonetheless pass to You, without prejudice to any other rights or remedies Aveas may have, including:</p>

                  <p>c. Aveas reserves, in its sole discretion, the right to deactivate subscriptions to the Product which has been obtained through any unauthorized means.</p>

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE, IN NO EVENT WILL AVEAS BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT OR SIMILAR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY LOST PROFITS OR LOST DATA ARISING OUT OF THE PURCHASE OF PRODUCT EVEN IF AVEAS HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO CASE SHALL AVEAS’ LIABILITY EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID FOR THE APPLICABLE PRODUCT.</p>
                  <p>c. Proprietary Rights.
